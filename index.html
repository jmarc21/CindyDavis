                <h1>My Vision</h1>
                <p>Parents have the primary responsibility for the development of their children. Their attitude, encouragement
                    and involvement have the most influence in a child’s growth and education. Over 90% of Utah parents enroll
                    their children in district and charter schools. These combine to create public schools for kids. Cindy
                    is uniquely qualified as both parent and practitioner to take a preK-post high school view of our education
                    system. The Utah constitution calls for the Utah Board of Education to oversee public education in our
                    state. Too often we have top-down unfunded mandates that reduce the nimbleness of schools and impair
                    local ability to meet student needs. Cindy will work for policies that make sense for schools and families.</p>

                        <p class="viewContent">Funding for schools is needed. As our legislature provides funding for the WPU, it is important to
                            recognize that some money is needed just to cover growth and inflation, so increases can be deceiving.
                            Due to an income tax reduction and a constitutional change to divide K-12 funding with higher
                            ed, schools have seen considerable cuts in resources. We are not back to 2008 pre-recession funding
                            for education. While revenue generation for education does not fall under the purview of USBE,
                            stewardship and oversight of Utah schools does. Board members can define and express need to
                            legislators, and in turn, act as responsible stewards of allocations.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="transparency" class="displayNone">
                        <p class="viewContent">Public trust must be earned, and transparency is key to earning that trust. As a parent I have appreciated
                            the effort that the board has made to broadcast meetings online. I have also appreciated the
                            many reports that the board generates and publishes for all to consider. Additionally, when important
                            changes are to be made, not only has there been an opportunity for public input at board meetings,
                            but separate meetings have been scheduled for the sole purpose of listening to stakeholder input.
                            I would support all of those things continuing and anything additional that could increase transparency
                            for the Board of Education.</p>

                        <p class="viewContent">Thank you, teachers. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We are losing many of our teachers to other
                            states or professions. Attrition is concerning, and finding qualified applicants to teach is
                            not always easy, especially during a healthy economy. We must look at recruitment, induction,
                            and retention when it comes to our teaching force in Utah. That means listening to those who
                            have boots on the ground and working together so that policymakers, practitioners, and parents
                            can form bridges that will lead to a healthy educational milieu in our state.</p>

                        <p class="viewContent">As a principal, I was blown away by the service rendered by you, as parents to our school. You could
                            have sat on the sidelines and complained about the million difficulties public education experiences.
                            However, you jumped in. You got on board. You spent your time, energy, and resources helping
                            in any way you could. I am mostly a stay at home parent now, and have tried to emulate you. As
                            your principal, while nowhere near perfect, I tried to honor, respect, seek and implement your
                            feedback. I said often as a principal, “If plan A doesn’t work, we will try Plan B. If Plan B
                            doesn’t work, we will try plan C. If plan C doesn’t work, we will try plan D,” and so on. We
                            as parents must advocate for what we feel is right for our students, and we as practitioners
                            and policy makers must partner with parents.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="policy" class="displayNone">
                        <p class="viewContent">I believe that all policy makers have a responsibility to finetooth comb policy and look for ways
                            to support schools rather than give top down unfunded mandate’s. Educators have plates that are
                            burgeoning, and not just from trying to meet vastly varied student needs. This is happening from
                            a myriad of requirements that may or may not be funded, may or may not have technical support,
                            may or may not have training provided, may or may not even make an impact on students. Administrators,
                            teachers staff, and parents are working hard for our children. The mountain they have to climb
                            does not need to be made steeper by unnecessary or unfunded mandates.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="tone" class="displayNone">
                        <p class="viewContent">Sometimes I say to policymakers, “There is something you could do for education in the state of Utah
                            and it wouldn’t cost one red cent. We could change our tone. We could seek to find the good while
                            we also work diligently to extinguish the bad. We could give credit where credit is due even
                            while trying to innovate and constantly improve education for our children. As colleagues, constituents,
                            caregivers, critics, and community members, we could speak respectfully to one another even when
                            we disagree. We could move forward in professional ways to find not only compromise but consensus.
                            I have always thought that the longer we communicate, the more we will find we have in common
                            than otherwise. Let’s tackle problems together not tackle each other in the process.</p>
